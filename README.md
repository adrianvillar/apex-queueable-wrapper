# Queueable Wrapper
Useful utility to make Queueable chaining easier.


* Code with example scripts can be found in the **_./scripts_** folder
* project.json is initialized with **_./example_standard_** source code which uses standard 
System.enqueueJob for working with Queueables.
* In order to test code with QueueableWrapper update your project.json to include 
**_example_queueableWrapper_** instead of **_example_standard_**

More detailed documentation will be coming soon...

Here is the link to Medium where I try to explaing how it works
